If your conda (base) envrionment automatically gets activated, you can remove that by  typing 

```bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

in your Windows Powershell.

Also, if you want to want to delete your virtual environment .venv, type ```deactivate``` in your terminal, and then delete the .venv folder your workspace, you might then restart the VSCode
